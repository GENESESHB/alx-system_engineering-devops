Answer:
	We now have 3 servers. We distributed the application server, webserver
	and database with in their own server. Now they became a cluster server
	which is what happens when a group of servers works as a unit. 
	We will also add another HAproxy loadbalancer to distribute work load 
	among them. This load balancer will work with the other load balancer
	to ditribute the work load among the servers.
